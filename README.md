ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rafalsionkowski it is my first Java Selenium Automation Project. <BR>
ðŸ‘€ I develop project based on online demo store: http://automationpractice.com

  
  I used elements likes:
  <li> Page Object Model - separate classes for managing web elements, actions and test logic
  <li> Log4j - for logging errors and events
  <li> Test Listiners - for listening to test results and taking action
  <li> Screen Shot Tests
  <li> Retry Analyzer - to retry test when fail
  <li> Integration with MySQL DB
